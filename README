NAME
    Net::BitTorrent - Wheeeeeeee!!!

Synopsis
      use Net::BitTorrent;
      use AnyEvent;

      my $c = Net::BitTorrent->new();

      # XXX - callback system is incomplete

      my $t = $c->add_torrent( path => 'a/legal.torrent' )
          || die 'Cannot load .torrent';

      $c->run; # Simple wrapper around AnyEvent->condvar->recv

Description
    Net::BitTorrent is a class based implementation of the BitTorrent
    Protocol for distributed data exchange.

******************************************************************************
    Note that this distribution is being rewritten from scratch and will
    eventually use Moose and AnyEvent. If you see this notice, I am probably
    trying out some new thing I'd like to have some CPAN tester data on.

    You are invited to test but please DO NOT ATTEMPT TO USE THIS IN
    PRODUCTION as everything from the API to basic internal functionality is
    subject to change. For more, see the module's repository on
    github.com/sanko/net-bittorrent
    <http://github.com/sanko/net-bittorrent>.

    All bugs and feature requests should be made on the issue tracker found
    at github.com/sanko/net-bittorrent/issues
    <http://github.com/sanko/net-bittorrent/isues> or via IRC at
