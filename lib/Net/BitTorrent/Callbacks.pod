Net::BitTorrent::Callbacks - Callback API documentation

=head1 Description

Note: If kept up to date, this file will list and describe all callbacks
supported by the L<Net::BitTorrent> distribution. Currently, only a few
callbacks are implemented and they're all subject to chagne but until I get a
stable version from this branch, consider this the official specification.

TMTOWTDI. The first (and probably the least troublesome) is to set callbacks
in the object's constructor:

    use Net::BitTorrent;
    my $client = Net::BitTorrent->new(
        on_file_error => sub { ... }
    );

You can also register a callback with C<< $obj->on_[event]( &coderef ) >>.
For example:

    $client->on_file_error( \&cb_file_error );
    sub cb_file_error {
        ...;
    }

=head2 Arguments Passed to Callbacks

When triggered, callbacks receive a hashref containing at least the following
key/value pairs: X<basic_arguments>

=over

=item B<message> => string

This is a (often simple) description (in English) of the event suitable for
display to the user.

=item B<event> => string

This is the kind of event which was triggered. This is useful if you use a
single callback coderef for many types of events (by category, etc.).

=item B<severity> => debug|info|warning|critical|fatal

This is an enum value which may be one of the following:

=over

=item debug

This will include a lot of debug events that can be used both for debugging
L<Net::BitTorrent> itself but also when debugging other clients that are
connected to L<Net::BitTorrent>. It will report strange behaviors among the
connected peers.

=item info

Events that can be considered normal, but still deserve an event. Something
like a new piece passing a hash check.

=item warning

Messages with the warning severity can be a tracker that times out or responds
with invalid data. The failing event will likely be retried automatically
(in this example, the next tracker in a multitracker sequence will be tried).
Warnings do not require user interaction.

=item critical

Errors which require user interaction or have an important message should
never ignored.

=item fatal

Examples of fatal errors can be disk full or something else that will make it
impossible to continue normal execution. Do not assume fatal errors lead to
total client failure (exit/die/croak) because that's annoying.

=back

=back

Note that the object is not returned

Other, event-specific arguments are documented below.

=head2 Callback Return Values

Unless mentioned specifically, return values from callbacks do not affect
behavior.

=head1 The Callbacks

This is the current list of callback triggering events and the information
passed to them. Note that this list is subject to change.

=over

=item C<listen_failure>

This alert is generated when none of the ports given in the port range to
C<new>[<1|Net::BitTorrent/"new">, L<2|Net::BitTorrent::Standalone/"new">] can
be opened for listening. This is a C<fatal> error.

In addition to the L<basic attributes|basic_arguments>, this callback is
passed the following attributes:

=over

=item C<protocol>

This is either C<tcp4>, C<tcp6>, C<udp4>, or C<udp>.

=back

=item C<listen_success>

This alert is generated when one of the ports given in the port range to
C<new>[<1|Net::BitTorrent/"new">, L<2|Net::BitTorrent::Standalone/"new">] was
opened for listening. This is a C<debug> event.

In addition to the L<basic attributes|basic_arguments>, this callback is
passed the following attributes:

=over

=item C<port>

This is an integer.

=item C<protocol>

This is either C<tcp4>, C<tcp6>, C<udp4>, or C<udp>.

=back

=item C<ip_filter>

This alert is generated when a connection is declined because the remote host
was L<banned|Net::BitTorrent::Network::IPFilter/"is_banned"> by our local
L<ipfilter|Net::BitTorrent::Network::IPFilter>. This is a C<debug>ging event.

In addition to the L<basic attributes|basic_arguments>, this callback is
passed the following attributes:

=over

=item C<ip>

This is the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the banned peer.

=item C<port>

This is an integer.

=item C<protocol>

This is either C<tcp4>, C<tcp6>, C<udp4>, or C<udp>.

=item C<rule>

This is the L<Net::BitTorrent::Network::IPFilter::Rule> object which caused
this peer to result in a banned state.

=back

=item C<file_error>

If the storage fails to read or write files that it needs access to, this
alert is generated and the torrent is paused. This is a C<fatal> error.

In addition to the L<basic attributes|basic_arguments>, this callback is
passed the following attributes:

=over

=item C<torrent>

This is the related L<Net::BitTorrent::Torrent> object.

=back

=item C<tracker_announce>

This alert is generated each time a tracker announce is sent (or attempted to
be sent). This is an C<info> alert.

In addition to the L<basic attributes|basic_arguments>, this callback is
passed the following attributes:

=over

=item C<torrent>

This is the related L<Net::BitTorrent::Torrent> object.

=back

=item C<tracker_error>

This alert is generated on tracker time outs, premature disconnects, invalid
response or a HTTP response other than C<200 OK>. From the alert you can get
the handle to the torrent the tracker belongs to. This alert is generated as
severity level C<warning>.

In addition to the L<basic attributes|basic_arguments>, this callback is
passed the following attributes:

=over

=item C<torrent>

This is the related L<Net::BitTorrent::Torrent> object.

=item C<times_in_row>

This is the number of times in a row this tracker has failed.

=item C<status_code>

This is the code returned from the HTTP server. C<401> means the tracker needs
authentication, C<404> means not found, etc. If the tracker timed out, the
code will be set to C<0>.

=back

=item C<tracker_reply>

This is an C<info>rmational alert generated when a tracker announce succeeds.

=item C<tracker_warning>

This alert is triggered if the tracker reply contains a warning field. Usually
this means that the tracker announce was successful but the tracker has a
message to the client. It is generated with severity level C<warning>.

In addition to the L<basic attributes|basic_arguments>, this callback is

This alert is generated when a finished piece fails its hash check. You can
get the handle to the torrent which got the failed piece and the index of the
piece itself from this alert. This alert is generated as severity level
